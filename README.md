# LAN-Multiplayer-Game
Ridiculously simplistic LAN Python Game.

Dev notes: This lacks a Settings file for now so you have to configure your version of the game on your own.

BASICALLY this is a very simplistic LAN multiplayer game which basically works by updating 2 shared txt files over your local network between two computers.

You will have to duplicate this code on both computers and spawn your client.
Remember to configure it appropriately!
